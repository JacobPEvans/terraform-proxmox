# If a referenced datastore doesn't exist, the provider returns a clear error.
# Previous check blocks were removed because the BPG provider doesn't mark

# Common datastores in our environment:
#   - local       (dir, /var/lib/vz)          - ISOs, templates, backups
#   - local-zfs   (zfspool, rpool/data)       - VM disks, container rootfs
