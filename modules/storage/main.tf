# Note: Proxmox datastore creation is typically done manually or via Proxmox API
# The bpg/proxmox provider doesn't support datastore creation through Terraform
# This is documented in Proxmox best practices to manage storage at the hypervisor level
# Additional datastores should be configured directly in Proxmox VE before running Terraform
