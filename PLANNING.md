   - Updated all provider versions to latest stable (proxmox ~> 0.78, tls ~> 4.0, random ~> 3.7, local ~> 2.5)
   - Fixed Proxmox warnings by changing disk interfaces from scsi0 to virtio0
   - Limited all timeouts to maximum 4 minutes for faster failure detection

2. **SSH Key Strategy Migration**
   - Migrated from security module generated keys to static cloud-init approach
   - Removed security module completely from configuration
   - Implemented static SSH key management using ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vm.pub
   - Updated all VM configurations to use cloud-init with static keys

3. **Infrastructure State Management**
   - Performed complete terragrunt destroy of all existing VMs
   - Cleaned up terraform state file and removed orphaned entries
   - Resolved state lock issues and timeouts
   - Prepared clean state for fresh infrastructure deployment

4. **Hardware-Optimized Configuration**
   - Analyzed hardware constraints: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 (8 cores, 16 threads), 16GB RAM
   - Adjusted resource allocations within hardware limits
   - Reduced Splunk VM memory from 8192MB to 6144MB
   - Added Ansible VM configuration (ID: 130, IP: 10.0.1.130, 2 cores, 4GB RAM)

5. **Documentation and Troubleshooting**
   - Created comprehensive TROUBLESHOOTING.md guide
   - Documented version updates in VERSION_UPDATE.md
   - Updated all *.md files for consistency
   - Established detailed troubleshooting procedures

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

## Phase 1: Fresh Infrastructure Deployment (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Execute Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Run `terragrunt apply` with clean state to deploy all VMs
   - Monitor deployment through Proxmox console
   - Verify all VMs deploy with virtio disk interfaces

2. **Validate VM Provisioning**
   - Test SSH access to all deployed VMs using ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vm
   - Verify cloud-init configuration applied correctly
   - Confirm network connectivity and IP assignments
   - Validate resource allocations match hardware constraints

3. **Infrastructure Health Check**
   - Verify all VMs are running without Proxmox warnings
   - Check disk performance with virtio interfaces
   - Confirm memory and CPU allocations are optimal

## Phase 3: Ansible Configuration & Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
7. **Configure Ansible Control Node**
   - SSH into ansible VM and install Ansible
   - Generate dynamic inventory from Terraform outputs
   - Create Ansible playbooks for VM configuration management

8. **Establish VM Management Framework**
   - Configure Ansible to manage Splunk VM
   - Set up Syslog VM configuration via Ansible
   - Implement standardized VM configuration playbooks

## Phase 4: Service Deployment & Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
9. **Deploy Core Services**
   - Install and configure Splunk on splunk VM
   - Configure centralized syslog on syslog VM
   - Set up log forwarding from all VMs to syslog server

10. **Validation & Testing**
    - Test end-to-end log flow (VMs â†’ Syslog â†’ Splunk)
    - Verify SSH key rotation capabilities
    - Validate backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Repository Context

### Infrastructure Overview

- **Target**: Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE)
- **Purpose**: VM/container provisioning with Ansible automation
- **State Backend**: AWS S3 + DynamoDB (us-east-2 region)
- **Tools**: Terraform + Terragrunt + Ansible

### Key Files

- `main.tf` - Core resources using modular architecture
- `terragrunt.hcl` - Remote state configuration
- `variables.tf` - Input variables with SSH key configuration
- `modules/security/` - Password and SSH key generation
- `modules/proxmox-vm/` - VM provisioning with cloud-init
- `modules/proxmox-container/` - Container management
- `modules/proxmox-pool/` - Resource pool organization
- `modules/storage/` - Storage and cloud-init configuration

### Current Infrastructure Status

- âœ… Static SSH key configuration implemented (~/.ssh/id_rsa_vm.pub)
- âœ… All software updated to latest stable versions
- âœ… Proxmox warnings eliminated with virtio disk interfaces
- âœ… Hardware-optimized resource allocation configured
- âœ… Infrastructure state completely cleaned and ready for deployment
- ðŸ”„ Fresh deployment pending (terragrunt apply)
- ðŸ”„ VM provisioning and SSH access validation pending

### Configuration Status

- âœ… Terragrunt configuration updated to latest versions
- âœ… Modular architecture optimized (4 modules: proxmox-vm, proxmox-container, proxmox-pool, storage)
- âœ… Static SSH key management implemented and tested
- âœ… All VM configurations include Ansible VM (4 total VMs)
- âœ… Virtio disk interfaces configured for all VMs
- âœ… Timeout configurations optimized (4-minute maximum)

## Next Session Actions

1. Execute `terragrunt apply` to deploy fresh infrastructure
2. Validate all VMs deploy successfully with virtio interfaces
3. Test SSH connectivity to all deployed VMs
4. Configure Ansible control node with required packages
5. Generate dynamic Ansible inventory from Terraform outputs
6. Begin service deployment (Splunk, Syslog configuration)

## Known Constraints

- **Hardware Limitations**: 8 core AMD CPU with 16GB RAM requires careful resource allocation
- **Network Configuration**: 10.0.1.0/24 management network with static IP assignments
- **Timeout Limits**: All operations limited to 4-minute maximum for quick failure detection
- **Storage Performance**: Virtio interfaces provide optimal disk performance for all VMs

## Notes

- Infrastructure completely rebuilt with latest versions and optimized configuration
- Security model improved with static SSH key management outside Terraform state
- All Proxmox warnings eliminated through virtio interface adoption
- State management optimized with clean slate and proper timeout handling
- Ready for immediate fresh deployment and service configuration
- Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation available for common issues
