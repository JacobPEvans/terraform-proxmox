# Project Status & Planning

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Ansible VM Completion (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Resolve Ansible VM Deployment Conflict**
   - VM 100 config file already exists in Proxmox
   - Need to clean up existing VM configuration safely
   - Redeploy with proper cloud-init and SSH key provisioning

2. **Test Ansible VM Functionality**
   - Verify SSH key access and Ansible installation
   - Test inventory file generation and connectivity
   - Validate cloud-init package installation completed

### Phase 2: Ansible Configuration Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Create Ansible Playbooks**
   - Develop base system configuration playbooks
   - Create security update and hardening playbooks
   - Implement VM-specific service deployment playbooks

2. **Deploy Services via Ansible**
   - Configure rsyslog on syslog VM for centralized logging
   - Deploy and configure Splunk on splunk VM
   - Set up log forwarding from all VMs to syslog server

### Phase 3: Service Validation & Operations (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete log flow: VMs ‚Üí Syslog ‚Üí Splunk
   - Verify log analysis and search capabilities in Splunk
   - Validate monitoring and alerting functionality

2. **Operational Readiness**
   - Document standard operating procedures
   - Implement backup and recovery testing
   - Verify SSH key rotation and access management

## Current Infrastructure Status

- ‚úÖ VMs Deployed: ansible (100), claude (110), syslog (120), splunk (130)
- ‚úÖ SSH Connectivity: All VMs accessible with shared SSH key
- ‚úÖ Cloud-init Configuration: Prepared for Ansible VM with packages and tools
- ‚úÖ SSH Key Provisioning: Secure null_resource approach implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ansible VM: Needs redeployment due to Proxmox config conflict

## Next Session Actions

1. Resolve Proxmox VM 100 config conflict (manual cleanup or different approach)
2. Complete Ansible VM deployment with cloud-init configuration
3. Test Ansible functionality and inventory connectivity
4. Begin service deployment via Ansible playbooks
5. Implement centralized logging infrastructure
