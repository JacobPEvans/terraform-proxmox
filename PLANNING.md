# Project Status & Planning

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### High Priority

* **Fully Automated Cloud-init Scripts**: Complete implementation of cloud-init automation for all VMs to enable destroy/recreate lifecycle  
  without manual intervention. Critical for infrastructure reliability and testing workflows.
* **Complete Infrastructure Deployment**: All 5 VMs successfully deployed with verified state management

### Phase 1: Kubernetes k3s and Docker Container Setup (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Basic VM with k3s and Docker Containers**
   * Deploy and configure containers VM (140) with Kubernetes k3s cluster
   * Set up Docker runtime environment for container orchestration
   * Verify k3s cluster initialization and node readiness
   * Test basic pod deployment and service connectivity
   * Configure persistent volume storage for containerized applications

2. **Container Infrastructure Validation**
   * Deploy test applications to verify k3s functionality
   * Validate Docker container operations and networking
   * Test inter-pod communication and service discovery
   * Verify persistent storage and volume mounting capabilities

### Phase 2: Fully Automated Cloud-init Configuration (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Fix External Cloud-init File Integration**
   * Investigate why external cloud-init file `ansible-server.local.yml` is not being applied to VMs
   * VM creates successfully but only applies basic template cloud-init, not external file content
   * External file contains comprehensive Ansible installation and configuration
   * Use targeted VM operations for faster troubleshooting (2-5 minute cycles vs 30+ minute full cycles)

2. **Complete Automated VM Configuration**
   * Ensure all VMs can be destroyed and recreated with full automation
   * Verify Ansible cloud-init configuration works fully without manual intervention
   * Test SSH connectivity from Ansible server to all VMs automatically
   * Validate all VMs are completely configured via cloud-init only (no manual steps)
   * Implement comprehensive service installation and configuration automation

### Phase 3: Ansible Configuration Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Create Ansible Playbooks**
   * Develop base system configuration playbooks
   * Create security update and hardening playbooks
   * Implement VM-specific service deployment playbooks

2. **Deploy Services via Ansible**
   * Configure rsyslog on syslog VM (120) for centralized logging
   * Deploy and configure Splunk on splunk VM (130)
   * Set up Kubernetes k3s and Docker on containers VM (140)
   * Set up log forwarding from all VMs to syslog server

### Phase 4: Repository Organization (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **Clean Up Root Directory Structure**
   * Separate Terraform .tf files from documentation .md files
   * Reorganize *.tf files into logical subdirectories (infrastructure/, environments/, etc.)
   * Keep high-level documentation (README.md, etc.) in root directory
   * Ensure terragrunt.hcl and configuration files work after reorganization
   * Test complete infrastructure deployment after reorganization

### Phase 5: Service Validation & Operations (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   * Test complete log flow: VMs → Syslog → Splunk
   * Verify log analysis and search capabilities in Splunk
   * Validate monitoring and alerting functionality

2. **Operational Readiness**
   * Document standard operating procedures
   * Implement backup and recovery testing
   * Verify SSH key rotation and access management

## Current Infrastructure Status

* ✅ VMs Configuration: ansible (100), claude (110), syslog (120), splunk (130), containers (140) - defined in terraform.tfvars
* ✅ Cloud-init Configuration: External file-based configuration implemented
* ✅ SSH Key Provisioning: Secure null_resource approach implemented
* ✅ Variable-based Security: Sensitive files protected by .gitignore patterns
* ✅ Provider Updates: All providers updated to latest versions (TLS ~> 4.1, Proxmox 0.81.0)
* ✅ Configuration Validation: All Terraform syntax validated successfully
* ✅ Backend Configuration: S3 + DynamoDB backend working reliably
* ✅ **RESOLVED**: Terraform State Synchronization - All refresh operations work perfectly
* ✅ **RESOLVED**: DynamoDB Lock Management - State locks acquire/release properly in 1-3 seconds
* ✅ **RESOLVED**: Provider Communication - bpg/proxmox provider refresh operations functional
* ✅ Infrastructure Deployment: All 5 VMs successfully deployed and managed by Terraform
* ✅ Complete VM Lifecycle: Destroy/apply operations working reliably with fast state management

## Next Session Actions

1. **HIGH PRIORITY: Implement Fully Automated Cloud-init Scripts**
   * Fix cloud-init external file integration to enable complete VM automation
   * Ensure all VMs can be destroyed and recreated without manual intervention
   * Test comprehensive cloud-init scripts for Ansible server, containers VM, and service VMs
   * Validate destroy → apply lifecycle works reliably with full automation

2. **Deploy Kubernetes k3s and Docker Infrastructure**
   * Configure k3s cluster initialization on containers VM (140)
   * Set up Docker runtime environment for container orchestration
   * Test pod deployment and basic cluster functionality

3. **Infrastructure Lifecycle Validation**
   * Verify all 5 VMs deploy successfully with resolved state management
   * Test complete Terraform lifecycle: plan → apply → destroy → apply
   * Validate SSH connectivity and VM management through Terraform
   * Confirm state operations remain fast and reliable

4. **Complete Missing Module Documentation**
   * Create README.md for modules/proxmox-container/ module
   * Create README.md for modules/security/ module
   * Create README.md for modules/storage/ module
   * Consolidate duplicate requirements across module READMEs

5. **Post-Deployment: Service Configuration**
   * Resume cloud-init external file integration debugging
   * Configure Ansible server for VM management automation
   * Set up centralized logging infrastructure (syslog → splunk)
