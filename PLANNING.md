# Project Status & Planning

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Critical Priority
* **CRITICAL STATE DRIFT ISSUE**: Complete Terraform state synchronization failure. VM imports consistently hang during Proxmox provider refresh phase, leaving DynamoDB locks abandoned and preventing state updates. See TERRAGRUNT_STATE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for comprehensive analysis and resolution strategies.
* **Infrastructure State Mismatch**: `terragrunt state list` shows only data sources while 3 VMs exist in Proxmox (ansible=100, claude=110, splunk=120). This prevents proper lifecycle management and would force recreation on every apply operation.

### Phase 1: Cloud-init Configuration Fix (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Fix External Cloud-init File Integration**
   - Investigate why external cloud-init file `ansible-server.local.yml` is not being applied to VMs
   - VM creates successfully but only applies basic template cloud-init, not external file content
   - External file contains comprehensive Ansible installation and configuration
   - Use targeted VM operations for faster troubleshooting (2-5 minute cycles vs 30+ minute full cycles)

2. **Complete Infrastructure Testing Cycle**
   - ‚úÖ Perform clean terragrunt destroy ‚Üí apply cycle (COMPLETED - VMs created successfully)
   - üîÑ Verify Ansible cloud-init configuration works fully (BLOCKED - external file not applied)
   - ‚è≥ Test SSH connectivity from Ansible server to all VMs without manual intervention (PENDING - depends on cloud-init fix)
   - ‚è≥ Validate Ansible server is completely configured via cloud-init only (PENDING - ansible not installed)

### Phase 2: Ansible Configuration Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Create Ansible Playbooks**
   - Develop base system configuration playbooks
   - Create security update and hardening playbooks
   - Implement VM-specific service deployment playbooks

2. **Deploy Services via Ansible**
   - Configure rsyslog on syslog VM for centralized logging
   - Deploy and configure Splunk on splunk VM
   - Set up log forwarding from all VMs to syslog server

### Phase 3: Repository Organization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Clean Up Root Directory Structure**
   - Separate Terraform .tf files from documentation .md files
   - Reorganize *.tf files into logical subdirectories (infrastructure/, environments/, etc.)
   - Keep high-level documentation (README.md, etc.) in root directory
   - Ensure terragrunt.hcl and configuration files work after reorganization
   - Test complete infrastructure deployment after reorganization

### Phase 4: Service Validation & Operations (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete log flow: VMs ‚Üí Syslog ‚Üí Splunk
   - Verify log analysis and search capabilities in Splunk
   - Validate monitoring and alerting functionality

2. **Operational Readiness**
   - Document standard operating procedures
   - Implement backup and recovery testing
   - Verify SSH key rotation and access management

## Current Infrastructure Status

- ‚úÖ VMs Configuration: ansible (100), claude (110), splunk (120) - physically exist in Proxmox
- ‚úÖ Cloud-init Configuration: External file-based configuration implemented
- ‚úÖ SSH Key Provisioning: Secure null_resource approach implemented
- ‚úÖ Variable-based Security: Sensitive files protected by .gitignore patterns
- ‚úÖ Provider Updates: All providers updated to latest versions (TLS ~> 4.1, Proxmox 0.79.0)
- ‚úÖ Configuration Validation: All Terraform syntax validated successfully
- ‚úÖ Backend Reconfiguration: Successfully resolved terragrunt.hcl conflicts
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Terraform State Synchronization - Complete failure to import existing VMs
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: DynamoDB Lock Abandonment - Import operations hang indefinitely during refresh
- üîÑ Cloud-init External File Integration: Blocked by state synchronization issues
- ‚è≥ Ansible Installation: Cannot proceed until state issues resolved

## Next Session Actions

1. **CRITICAL: Resolve Terraform State Synchronization**
   - Follow resolution strategies in TERRAGRUNT_STATE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
   - Choose between VM configuration reconciliation or clean rebuild approach
   - Implement pre-operation health checks to prevent future lock abandonment
   - Test VM imports with debug logging to identify exact hang point

2. **Implement State Management Safeguards**
   - Deploy automated DynamoDB lock monitoring and cleanup procedures
   - Add provider timeout configuration to prevent indefinite hangs
   - Create state backup procedures before major operations
   - Implement state drift detection monitoring

3. **Post-Resolution: Cloud-init Configuration**
   - Once state synchronization works, resume cloud-init external file debugging
   - Use targeted VM operations from TROUBLESHOOTING.md for faster iteration
   - Test cloud-init application via single VM destroy/apply cycles

4. **Validate Complete Infrastructure Lifecycle**
   - Verify that plan/apply/destroy operations work correctly with managed state
   - Test SSH connectivity and VM management through Terraform
   - Resume Ansible server configuration and service deployment
