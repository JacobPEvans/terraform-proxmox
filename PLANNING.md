# Project Status & Planning

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Critical Priority

* **CRITICAL STATE DRIFT ISSUE**: Complete Terraform state synchronization failure. VM imports consistently hang during Proxmox provider  
  refresh phase, leaving DynamoDB locks abandoned and preventing state updates. See TERRAGRUNT_STATE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for comprehensive  
  analysis and resolution strategies.
* **Infrastructure State Mismatch**: `terragrunt state list` shows only data sources while 5 VMs exist in Proxmox  
  (ansible=100, claude=110, syslog=120, splunk=130, containers=140). This prevents proper lifecycle management and would force  
  recreation on every apply operation.

### Phase 1: Cloud-init Configuration Fix (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Fix External Cloud-init File Integration**
   * Investigate why external cloud-init file `ansible-server.local.yml` is not being applied to VMs
   * VM creates successfully but only applies basic template cloud-init, not external file content
   * External file contains comprehensive Ansible installation and configuration
   * Use targeted VM operations for faster troubleshooting (2-5 minute cycles vs 30+ minute full cycles)

2. **Complete Infrastructure Testing Cycle**
   * ‚úÖ Perform clean terragrunt destroy ‚Üí apply cycle (COMPLETED - VMs created successfully)
   * üîÑ Verify Ansible cloud-init configuration works fully (BLOCKED - external file not applied)
   * ‚è≥ Test SSH connectivity from Ansible server to all VMs without manual intervention (PENDING - depends on cloud-init fix)
   * ‚è≥ Validate Ansible server is completely configured via cloud-init only (PENDING - ansible not installed)

### Phase 2: Ansible Configuration Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Create Ansible Playbooks**
   * Develop base system configuration playbooks
   * Create security update and hardening playbooks
   * Implement VM-specific service deployment playbooks

2. **Deploy Services via Ansible**
   * Configure rsyslog on syslog VM (120) for centralized logging
   * Deploy and configure Splunk on splunk VM (130)
   * Set up Kubernetes k3s and Docker on containers VM (140)
   * Set up log forwarding from all VMs to syslog server

### Phase 3: Repository Organization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Clean Up Root Directory Structure**
   * Separate Terraform .tf files from documentation .md files
   * Reorganize *.tf files into logical subdirectories (infrastructure/, environments/, etc.)
   * Keep high-level documentation (README.md, etc.) in root directory
   * Ensure terragrunt.hcl and configuration files work after reorganization
   * Test complete infrastructure deployment after reorganization

### Phase 4: Service Validation & Operations (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   * Test complete log flow: VMs ‚Üí Syslog ‚Üí Splunk
   * Verify log analysis and search capabilities in Splunk
   * Validate monitoring and alerting functionality

2. **Operational Readiness**
   * Document standard operating procedures
   * Implement backup and recovery testing
   * Verify SSH key rotation and access management

## Current Infrastructure Status

* ‚úÖ VMs Configuration: ansible (100), claude (110), syslog (120), splunk (130), containers (140) - physically exist in Proxmox
* ‚úÖ Cloud-init Configuration: External file-based configuration implemented
* ‚úÖ SSH Key Provisioning: Secure null_resource approach implemented
* ‚úÖ Variable-based Security: Sensitive files protected by .gitignore patterns
* ‚úÖ Provider Updates: All providers updated to latest versions (TLS ~> 4.1, Proxmox 0.79.0)
* ‚úÖ Configuration Validation: All Terraform syntax validated successfully
* ‚úÖ Backend Reconfiguration: Successfully resolved terragrunt.hcl conflicts
* ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Terraform State Synchronization - Complete failure to import existing VMs
* ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: DynamoDB Lock Abandonment - Import operations hang indefinitely during refresh
* üîÑ Cloud-init External File Integration: Blocked by state synchronization issues
* ‚è≥ Ansible Installation: Cannot proceed until state issues resolved

## Next Session Actions

1. **CRITICAL: Resolve Terraform State Synchronization**
   * Follow resolution strategies in TERRAGRUNT_STATE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
   * Choose between VM configuration reconciliation or clean rebuild approach
   * Implement pre-operation health checks to prevent future lock abandonment
   * Test VM imports with debug logging to identify exact hang point

2. **Implement State Management Safeguards**
   * Deploy automated DynamoDB lock monitoring and cleanup procedures
   * Add provider timeout configuration to prevent indefinite hangs
   * Create state backup procedures before major operations
   * Implement state drift detection monitoring

3. **Post-Resolution: Cloud-init Configuration**
   * Once state synchronization works, resume cloud-init external file debugging
   * Use targeted VM operations from TROUBLESHOOTING.md for faster iteration
   * Test cloud-init application via single VM destroy/apply cycles

4. **Complete Missing Module Documentation**
   * Create README.md for modules/proxmox-container/ module
   * Create README.md for modules/security/ module
   * Create README.md for modules/storage/ module
   * Consolidate duplicate requirements across module READMEs

5. **Validate Complete Infrastructure Lifecycle**
   * Verify that plan/apply/destroy operations work correctly with managed state
   * Test SSH connectivity and VM management through Terraform
   * Resume Ansible server configuration and service deployment

## Recent Updates (2025-08-04)

### Completed Tasks

* ‚úÖ **Documentation Review**: Comprehensive review completed fixing critical inconsistencies
* ‚úÖ **VM Configuration Documentation**: Updated all files to reflect 5-VM infrastructure
* ‚úÖ **Provider Version Consistency**: Fixed all module documentation version mismatches
* ‚úÖ **Architecture Documentation**: Corrected file structure diagrams and descriptions
* ‚úÖ **Containers VM Documentation**: Added new containers VM (140) to all relevant documentation

### Pending Documentation Tasks

* üìù **Missing Module READMEs**: 3 modules lack comprehensive documentation
* üìù **Requirements Consolidation**: Duplicate Terraform/Proxmox version requirements across 6+ files
* üìù **Markdownlint Compliance**: Validate all markdown files meet 160-character line limit standard
