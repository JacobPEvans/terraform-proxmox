# Project Status & Planning

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Fresh Infrastructure Deployment (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Execute Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Run `terragrunt apply -auto-approve` with clean state to deploy all VMs
   - Monitor deployment through Proxmox console
   - Verify all VMs deploy with virtio disk interfaces

2. **Validate VM Provisioning**
   - Test SSH access to all deployed VMs using configured keys
   - Verify cloud-init configuration applied correctly
   - Confirm network connectivity and IP assignments
   - Validate resource allocations match configuration

3. **Infrastructure Health Check**
   - Verify all VMs are running without Proxmox warnings
   - Check disk performance with virtio interfaces
   - Confirm memory and CPU allocations are optimal

### Phase 2: Ansible Configuration Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Configure Ansible Control Node**
   - SSH into ansible VM and install Ansible
   - Generate dynamic inventory from Terraform outputs
   - Create Ansible playbooks for VM configuration management

2. **Establish VM Management Framework**
   - Configure Ansible to manage Splunk VM
   - Set up Syslog VM configuration via Ansible
   - Implement standardized VM configuration playbooks

### Phase 3: Service Deployment & Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Deploy Core Services**
   - Install and configure Splunk on splunk VM
   - Configure centralized syslog on syslog VM
   - Set up log forwarding from all VMs to syslog server

2. **Validation & Testing**
    - Test end-to-end log flow (VMs â†’ Syslog â†’ Splunk)
    - Verify SSH key rotation capabilities
    - Validate backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Next Session Actions

1. Execute `terragrunt apply -auto-approve` to provision fresh infrastructure
2. Validate all VMs deploy successfully with optimized configurations
3. Test SSH connectivity to all deployed VMs
4. Configure Ansible control node with required packages
5. Generate dynamic Ansible inventory from Terraform outputs
6. Begin service deployment and configuration
