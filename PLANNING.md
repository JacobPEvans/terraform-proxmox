# Project Status & Planning

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Cloud-init Configuration Fix (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Fix External Cloud-init File Integration** 
   - Investigate why external cloud-init file `ansible-server.local.yml` is not being applied to VMs
   - VM creates successfully but only applies basic template cloud-init, not external file content
   - External file contains comprehensive Ansible installation and configuration
   - Use targeted VM operations for faster troubleshooting (2-5 minute cycles vs 30+ minute full cycles)

2. **Complete Infrastructure Testing Cycle**
   - ‚úÖ Perform clean terragrunt destroy ‚Üí apply cycle (COMPLETED - VMs created successfully)
   - üîÑ Verify Ansible cloud-init configuration works fully (BLOCKED - external file not applied)
   - ‚è≥ Test SSH connectivity from Ansible server to all VMs without manual intervention (PENDING - depends on cloud-init fix)
   - ‚è≥ Validate Ansible server is completely configured via cloud-init only (PENDING - ansible not installed)

### Phase 2: Ansible Configuration Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Create Ansible Playbooks**
   - Develop base system configuration playbooks
   - Create security update and hardening playbooks
   - Implement VM-specific service deployment playbooks

2. **Deploy Services via Ansible**
   - Configure rsyslog on syslog VM for centralized logging
   - Deploy and configure Splunk on splunk VM
   - Set up log forwarding from all VMs to syslog server

### Phase 3: Repository Organization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

1. **Clean Up Root Directory Structure**
   - Separate Terraform .tf files from documentation .md files
   - Reorganize *.tf files into logical subdirectories (infrastructure/, environments/, etc.)
   - Keep high-level documentation (README.md, etc.) in root directory
   - Ensure terragrunt.hcl and configuration files work after reorganization
   - Test complete infrastructure deployment after reorganization

### Phase 4: Service Validation & Operations (LOW PRIORITY)

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test complete log flow: VMs ‚Üí Syslog ‚Üí Splunk
   - Verify log analysis and search capabilities in Splunk
   - Validate monitoring and alerting functionality

2. **Operational Readiness**
   - Document standard operating procedures
   - Implement backup and recovery testing
   - Verify SSH key rotation and access management

## Current Infrastructure Status

- ‚úÖ VMs Configuration: ansible (100), claude (110), syslog (120), splunk (130)
- ‚úÖ Cloud-init Configuration: External file-based configuration implemented
- ‚úÖ SSH Key Provisioning: Secure null_resource approach implemented
- ‚úÖ Variable-based Security: Sensitive files protected by .gitignore patterns
- ‚úÖ DynamoDB Lock Issues: Resolved with proper timeout configuration
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure Testing: Complete destroy/apply cycle validated - VMs create successfully
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting Documentation: Added targeted VM operations for faster iteration
- üîÑ Cloud-init External File Integration: External files not being applied to VMs (critical issue)
- ‚è≥ Ansible Installation: Not working due to cloud-init issue

## Next Session Actions

1. **Investigate cloud-init external file integration issue**
   - Use targeted VM operations from TROUBLESHOOTING.md for faster iteration
   - Debug why `locals.ansible_cloud_init = file(var.ansible_cloud_init_file)` content isn't being applied
   - Examine how cloud-init content is passed to Proxmox VM module

2. **Fix cloud-init configuration**
   - Ensure external cloud-init files are properly merged with VM configuration
   - Validate cloud-init syntax and structure
   - Test cloud-init application via targeted VM destroy/apply cycles

3. **Validate Ansible server configuration**
   - Test SSH connectivity from Ansible server to all other VMs
   - Verify Ansible installation and configuration via cloud-init
   - Begin service deployment via Ansible playbooks once cloud-init works

4. **Implement centralized logging infrastructure**
   - Deploy rsyslog and Splunk services via Ansible automation
